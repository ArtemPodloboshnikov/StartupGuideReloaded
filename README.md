# StartupGuideReloaded
This is a hackathon ["Leaders of Digital Innovation"](https://leaders2021.innoagency.ru) in which you need to come up with and implement ideas on one of 10 topics. Teams from 3 to 5 people take part in the competition. My team chose the theme ["PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM BY SERVICES MOSCOW FOR STARTUPS"](https://leaders2021.innoagency.ru/01/) for the [Startup Guide](https://startupguide.innoagency.ru) website. The term is 2 weeks. During this time, I need to write a website for Next.js using [UI KIT](https://www.figma.com/file/UVnFGWphmyDVoQHHX9NlH2/Startup-Guide-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1). The backend will be written by another person in php based on the database that was issued as a sample.
